					David A. Brancaccio is an American radio and television journalist.
					He is the host of the public radio business program
					Marketplace Morning Report and the PBS newsmagazine <em>Now</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					He began his career in broadcasting on WTVL radio in 1976 at the
					age of fifteen. He received a Bachelor of Arts in African Studies
					and History from Wesleyan University in 1982 and a master's in
					journalism from Stanford University in 1988. He traveled widely,
					spending his fourth grade in Rome, his ninth grade in Fort Dauphin,
					Madagascar, and his senior year in college in Legon, Ghana.

					In 1989, Brancaccio began contributing to the public-radio
					program <em>Marketplace</em>. He was first named the program's
					European editor based in London, became senior editor and host
					in 1993, and under his tenure the show received both the
					DuPont-Columbia (1998) and George Foster Peabody (2001) awards.
				</p>

				<p>
					In 2003, Brancaccio left <em>Marketplace</em> to join Bill Moyers
					on <em>Now</em>. He was co-host for over a year prior to
					Moyers' retirement at the end of 2004, covering business
					innovation, politics, human rights, and science policy.

					Since 2011 he has anchored <em>The Marketplace Morning Report</em>
					and contributes to numerous outlets including CNN, CNBC, MSNBC,
					and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. His 2000 book
					<em>Squandering Aimlessly</em> chronicled a pilgrimage across
					America exploring how people apply personal values to their money.
